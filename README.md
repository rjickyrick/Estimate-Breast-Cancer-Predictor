# Project Briefing
One of the most common cancers diagnosed worldwide, including in India, is breast cancer. 
Despite the excellent survival rate, 97% of women can survive for more than 5 years with early diagnosis. 
According to statistics, the number of deaths caused by this illness has dramatically grown in recent years. 
Early detection is the biggest challenge in treating it. Therefore, in addition to medical remedies, 
certain Data Science solutions must be integrated to address the death-causing problem. 
The goal of this research is to determine whether a breast cancer is malignant or benign as well as to identify broad trends that might help us choose the 
right model and hyperparameters. Identifying whether a breast cancer is benign or malignant is the objective. 
In order to accomplish this, I fitted a function that can predict the discrete class of fresh input using 
the logistic regression machine learning classification approach.

# Conclusion
1. The project's goal is to determine if a tumour is malignant or benign.
2. Using the feature dataset and Logistic Regression algorithm predictions were made.
3. Logistic Regression provided accuracy of 92%.
4. After normalising the data, logistic regression properly categorising tumours as malignant or benign around 92â€“93% of the time.
